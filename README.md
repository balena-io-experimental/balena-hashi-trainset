# balena Hashi Trainset
A collaboration project between balena and HashiCorp to showcase joint capabilities in a fun and visual way.

This repository contains the necessary pieces to build a fun, interactive model railroad set that demonstrates the core competencies of both balenaCloud and HashiCorp's Consul and Nomad products.  Using model trains, we can "simulate" deplying workloads (containers) to systems, failures of nodes (trains), service discovery, and re-deployment of those workloads to other devices in the fleet.  The overall health of the system changes depending upon the environment, which is manipulated by traffic, crashes, power outages, etc.

Here is a quick breakdown of the relevant applications in use:

balenaCloud:  IoT Fleet Management application that allows for Docker-compatible containers to be pushed to remote devices at scale.
HashiCorp Consul:  A multi-cloud service networking platform to connect and secure services across any runtime platform.
HashiCorp Nomad:  An easy-to-use, flexible, and performant workload orchestrator.
